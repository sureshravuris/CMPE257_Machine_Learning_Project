Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high Where knowledge is free Where the world has not been broken up into fragments By narrow domestic walls Where words come out from the depth of truth Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit Where the mind is led forward by thee Into ever-widening thought and action Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake

No man is an island,Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the continent, A part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less. As well as if a promontory were. As well as if a manor of thy friend’s Or of thine own were: Any man’s death diminishes me, Because I am involved in mankind, And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound’s the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

In nature's embrace, I find solace and peace, Where worries dissolve, and anxieties cease. The sun paints the sky with hues so divine, As clouds gracefully drift, like dreams in line. The trees stand tall, guardians of the earth, Their branches reaching out, a symbol of rebirth. Flowers bloom, a symphony of colors rare, A fragrant dance, perfuming the air. Rivers flow, their waters pure and free, Reflecting the beauty that surrounds me. Nature's wonders, a sight to behold, A story of creation, forever untold.
