The ghost of the Tsar walks.
He passes some Jews and Gypsies.
One curses him; another throws a rock.
Bad angels fold their wings and watch.

Choirs sang at his birth,
Armies moved at his command.
God rang the bells
When he walked into cathedrals.
But now he hears the noise from out the east
And sees the fire in the western sky.

Death crowned him at his birth,
His cousins glittered throughout Europe.
He seldom followed good advice
And did not ask permission.
He lost a navy in a foreign sea
And an army gone at Tannenberg,
But still he played the emperor.
Magnificence is blind and deaf,
And death took all his dynasty.
